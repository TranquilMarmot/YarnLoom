All icons come from the [microsoft/vscode-codicons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons) repo. (with the exception of the `rename` icon which came from [the icon project](https://thenounproject.com/term/rename/61456/) and was modified).

To use an icon, do:

```jsx
import { ReactComponent as TrashIcon } from "../../icons/trash.svg";
```

Then, a `<TrashIcon />` component will be available and will render the SVG inline.

For more info, see [the `create-react-app` docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/#adding-svgs).
